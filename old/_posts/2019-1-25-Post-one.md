This is a post. Open up this post to get more information on how to set a post. These posts will show up under the featured bar located in the Blog area and the latest 3 posts will appear in the _Recent Posts_ in the Home page. Open up this post to get more information on how to set a featured post.

## Title & Subtitle
You can provide a subtitle in your front matter with the code `subtitle: <subtitle>`.  This is great, if you want to provide more information about the post. The subtitle text is coloured in a grey colour.

On the blog area, the featured posts only show the title. When the user clicks the featured post, the subtitle will be shown below the normal title in the post view.

**_Example:_**
<h3 class="text-muted">This is a featured post</h3>

`subtitle: This is a featured post`


## Image

So you can use any image that you like in the post header, all you need to do is specify it in the post front matter with the code `image: <img.jpg>`. Jekyll will automatically look into the folder _assets_ for the image that matches the name specified on the post front matter.

The header will stretch the image to fit the window so I'd recommend that you choose an image with a minimum size of 700x438, anything bigger will work just fine.

You can also add images to your post with the `<img>` tag. I've provided you with a `bg` class that you can use so your images span the whole length of the text area. This will set the image height to 400px so be aware that some distortion might happen.

**_Example:_**

<img class="bg" src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/jantine-doornbos-398339.jpg">

**Code:** `<img class="bg" src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/jantine-doornbos-398339.jpg">`

## Featured Posts

To mark a post as a featured post all you need to do is add `tags: Featured` to your front matter and the template will automatically add the latest post to the featured bar located in the Blog page.

The theme is set to show only the last 3 posts marked as featured. This would be the ideal number of featured posts. But if you are just staring the blog and you don't have enough posts to fill the Featured bar, the theme will resize the div so it doesn't look strange.

**_Example:_**

`tags: Featured`

## Feedback
This was my first attempt at creating a theme from scratch. I hope you like it as much as I did creating it, please do give me some feedback on it, I'd love to hear from you and improve my skills!
